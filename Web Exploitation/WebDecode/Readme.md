## Additional Informations:
#### Hints
1. Use the web inspector on other files included by the web page.
2. The flag may or may not be encoded

#### Links:
1. http://titan.picoctf.net:60527/

## Explain what we should do:
1. Firstly we need to enter the provided link to the browser and see if we can find anything useful,
2. Secondly we can look on the web inspector to find if there are any clues to find the flag,
3. If the flag is encrypted we need to decrypt it!

### Step 1:
Upon entering the web page, we found nothing useful

### Step 2:
We went to the each page while on inspector mode until we found this useful random words, which farmost looks familiar unless others

### Step 3:
We don't know which encryption was used on the provided texts so it is our duty to go to the random internet tools to do such stuffs
And upon using https://base64decode.org we are able to see the plain flag,
