## Additional Informations:
#### Hints
1. Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.
2. Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

#### Links:
1. http://titan.picoctf.net:64385/ ( may vary )

## Explain what we should do:
1. Open the burp suite and open the proxy tab and enable the intercept
2. Try numerous modifications to the requests until get the flag

### Step 1:
Open the burp suite and enable the intercept, if you don't know how you can google that..

### Step 2:
Now open the browser under burp monitoring and then, the page for registering has nothing special just fill the data.. don't forget to forward the request in burp suite otherwise you will stuck here forever!!

### Step 3:
Now here is the main part, fill the random information in the OTP field, don't forward the request in burp suite wait for next step

After that forward the header request and then go the browser to see the plain flag waiting for you

Now you got the flag!!,

## DISCLAIMER
I didn't put the flag public so I don't violate the picoCTF policy.
